### Project Description
The Waste Disposal Guidance web app helps users learn proper waste disposal methods while promoting sustainability. It provides clear instructions for disposing of waste, tracks carbon footprint reduction, and rewards users with Green Points for eco-friendly actions.
Why Use This App?
Reduce environmental impact by following proper waste practices.
Earn rewards for sustainable habits with Green Points.
Track your carbon footprint and contribute to a greener future.
Ideal for individuals and communities committed to sustainability!

### The Problem statement
Improper waste disposal is a growing environmental issue, leading to pollution, resource wastage, and increased carbon emissions. Many people lack awareness of correct disposal methods, recycling options, and their impact on the environment, which results in poor waste management practices. There is a need for an accessible and engaging solution to educate, motivate, and guide individuals toward responsible waste management.

### The Solution
With EcoSort, you’ll know exactly where your junk belongs. Tossing plastic into the recycling bin? Congrats, you’re a hero! Dumping batteries in the trash? Nope—EcoSort will call you out. Plus, we’ll reward your good behavior with Green Points (because everyone loves free stuff) and show you how much carbon you’re saving—so you can flex your eco-warrior status.
EcoSort makes waste disposal simple, smart, and kinda fun. Who knew saving the planet could feel this good?
